# Bio

Welcome to my page! I am currently a masters student in Biostatistics at Columbia University. Right now, I'm interested in functional data analysis methods in health problems and disease forecasting using Bayesian methods. Outside of work, I like hiking, rock climbing, listening to / making music, and chess.

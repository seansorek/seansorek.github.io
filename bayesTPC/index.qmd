**bayesTPC** is an R package to help conveniently fit common thermal performance models using Bayesian MCMC. We provide functionality to substitute for or supplement BUGS modelling workflows, especially for those without experience in Bayesian methods. To this end, **bayesTPC** contains a simple model specification format, BUGS configuration helpers, end-to-end model fitting methods, and model diagnostics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **bayesTPC** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("johnwilliamsmithjr/bayesTPC")
```

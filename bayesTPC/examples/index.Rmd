Here, we provide (insert final number) examples demonstrating the functionality of `bayesTPC`.

## Example 1: Non-Linear Trait Data with Normally Distributed Errors.

In this example, we show the original and most common use case of `bayesTPC`: easily and intuitively fitting traits that vary non-linearly with temperature.

## Example 2: Count Data

[Link](https://seansorek.github.io/bayesTPC/examples/pages/example2.html)

In this example, we fit count or survivorship data against temperature. To minimize tedious data transformation, `bayesTPC` supports fitting this type of data as binomial, bernoulli, or poisson random variables.
